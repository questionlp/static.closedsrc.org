<p>
DHCP is one of the most common network services found in corporations, home networks, and Internet
service providers that dynamically assign IP addresses from a specific pool to a device for a particular
length of time to help use allocated IP addresses more efficiently. In this article, I will provide the
basic steps on setting up a DHCP server on a FreeBSD machine using the
<a href="http://isc.org/products/DHCP/">Internet Software Consortium's DHCP</a> software (also known as
ISC DHCP). I will also provide links to other resources that can provide additional information on more
advanced configuration options. The version of ISC DHCP that I will be referring to in this article is
3.0.1rc9, and the version of FreeBSD that I used as a reference is 4.6-STABLE.
</p>

<h2>Installing ISC DHCP</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to install the ISC DHCP software package is to install from the Ports collection under
<code>net/isc-dhcp3</code>. You can also build and install the package from the
<a href="ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/dhcp/dhcp-3.0.1rc9.tar.gz">tarball</a> available from the ISC's FTP server.
I would highly recommend building and installing the ISC DHCP from the Ports collection, but before you
start the install process, you should have the latest version of the port on your system (which can be
done by using <code>cvsup</code>; more information on using <code>cvsup</code> can be found in the
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">FreeBSD Handbook</a>).
</p>

<p>
To install ISC DHCP from the Ports collection, run the following commands as root:
</p>

<pre>
	# cd /usr/ports/net/isc-dhcp3
	# make ; make install
</pre>

<p>
Once the port has finished building and installing, the DHCP d&aelig;mon, relay agent and the client
have been installed on the machine, with the main executables installed under <code>/usr/local/sbin</code>.
In order to use the newly installed DHCP client (say, if you are going to be running the DHCP d&aelig;mon
on a router/firewall that needs to get a dynamic address from your Internet service provider), you will
need to add the following line to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>:
</p>

<pre>
	dhcp_program=&quot;/usr/local/sbin/dhclient&quot;
</pre>

<p>
as the default is to use <code>dhclient</code> from <code>/sbin</code>. All of the configuration files will be
placed under <code>/usr/local/etc</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you decide to install ISC DHCP from the ISC tarball, the install can be done in a couple more steps
than via Ports, and differs in the sense that it the ISC tarball version will install the files under
<code>/usr/sbin</code> instead of <code>/usr/local/sbin</code> (with the exception of <code>dhclient</code> which is
installed in <code>/sbin</code>); and the configuration files would be placed under <code>/etc</code> instead of
<code>/usr/local/etc</code>. To build and install ISC DHCP from the ISC tarball, grab the tarball and do the
following steps as root:
</p>

<pre>
	# cd /path/to/tarball
	# tar zxf dhcp-3.0.1rc9.tar.gz
	# cd dhcp-3.01rc9/
	# ./configure
	<em>[configure output]</em>
	# make ; make install
</pre>

<p>
The install portion that is included with the ISC DHCP tarball does not include any scripts that would
start the DHCP d&aelig;mon upon startup; therefore, you will need to hack together a startup script and
place it under <code>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</code>. I will provide a very simple startup later in this article.
</p>

<h2>Configuring ISC DHCP For Your Network</h2>
<p>
After the package has been built and installed (either from Ports or from the tarball), the
configuration file(s) will need to be created to meet your requirements as well as configuration of the
startup options for the d&aelig;mon. The configuration file that you would use to configure the DHCP
server settings and lease pools is called <code>dhcpd.conf</code> and is located under
<code>/usr/local/etc</code> (or <code>/etc</code> for those who installed from the tarball). The configuration
syntax resembles a cross between PHP and the BIND configuration syntax.
</p>

<p>
Below is an example of a basic configuration that would be in <code>dhcpd.conf</code>:
</p>

<pre>
	ddns-update-style none;

	subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
		range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.100;
		default-lease-time 144000;
		max-lease-time 192000;
		option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
		option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
		option routers 192.168.1.2;
		option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.2;
		option domain-name &quot;foo.org&quot;;

		host quux {
			hardware ethernet ab:cd:ef:98:76:54;
			fixed-address 192.168.1.150;
		}
	}
</pre>

<p>
I have broken down each line below, explaining what each one means and what it effects.
</p>

<dl class="nocolon">
	<dt>ddns-update-style none;</dt>
	<dd>This setting disables dynamic DNS updates to be made to the designated DNS server.</dd>

	<dt>subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {</dt>
	<dd>Tells the DHCP server that the following block of settings apply to the specified IP subnet.</dd>

	<dt>range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.100;</dt>
	<dd>Sets the range of IP addresses available in the lease pool.</dd>

	<dt>default-lease-time 144000;</dt>
	<dd>The lease length (in seconds) that the server would set to a lease if it does not receive a
	lease length from the client.</dd>

	<dt>max-lease-time 192000;</dt>
	<dd>The maximum lease length (in seconds) that the server will set, even though the client may
	request a longer lease length.</dd>

	<dt>option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;</dt>
	<dd>The subnet mask of the network to send to the client.</dd>

	<dt>option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;</dt>
	<dd>Sets the broadcast address of the particular subnet that the client would reside on. This
	is usually the very last IP address of an IP address range or subnet.</dd>

	<dt>option routers 192.168.1.2;</dt>
	<dd>Sets the default router option for the client.</dd>

	<dt>option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3;</dt>
	<dd>Sets the domain name server (DNS) list that the client would use for domain name
	resolution. The list is comma delimited and should be listed in order of first to last
	preferred server.</dd>

	<dt>option domain-name &quot;foo.org&quot;;</dt>
	<dd>Sets the domain name option for the client, which the client would use (if properly
	supported) for domain name resolution as well what domain name to append to hostnames
	that are not fully qualified domain names.</dd>

	<dt>host quux</dt>
	<dd>This starts an IP reservation block to give a specific host a specific IP address (as if
	it were manually set with a static IP address).</dd>

	<dt>hardware ethernet ab:cd:ef:98:76:54;</dt>
	<dd>The Ethernet/MAC address that belongs to the client that would be leased a <em>static</em> address.</dd>

	<dt>fixed-address 192.168.1.100;</dt>
	<dd>The IP address of the reservation that would be given to the assigned client.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For more options and settings along with the syntax for each, refer to the dhcpd-options(5) manual page.
</p>

<p>
Once you have finished writing out the <code>dhcpd.conf</code> configuration file and have saved it under
the proper directory, you are almost ready to set the server to startup the d&aelig;mon using an rc
script. If you have installed ISC DHCP from a tarball, you will want to skip the following and click
<a href="#noports">here</a> in which you will need to create your own rc script.
</p>

<p>
If you have installed ISC DHCP from ports, you will need to make changes to the rc configuration file
before continuing. Open up the <code>rc.isc-dhcpd.conf</code> file under <code>/usr/local/etc</code> (if the
file is not there, copy the <code>rc.isc-dhcpd.conf.sample</code> file to <code>rc.isc-dhcpd.conf</code>) with
your favorite text editor. You will see two shell script variables that are set to nothing by default,
<code>dhcpd_options</code> and <code>dhcpd_ifaces</code>. Both variables are &quot;sucked&quot; in by the rc
script prior to starting up the d&aelig;mon. To prevent the d&aelig;mon from displaying the
copyright/license text each time it starts, add in <code>&quot;-q&quot;</code> (including the quotes)
after the <code>dhcpd_options</code> variable. Next, you will want to set the network interface that the
d&aelig;mon will listen to, which is critical if you will be running the d&aelig;mon on a FreeBSD
firewall, gateway or router. For example, if the interface that you want to have the d&aelig;mon
listen to is <code>xl0</code>, add <code>&quot;xl0&quot;</code> right after the <code>dhcpd_ifaces</code> variable.
Below is the least that you would need in the file in order for the rc script to start properly:
</p>

<pre>
	dhcpd_options=&quot;-q&quot;
	dhcpd_ifaces=&quot;xl0&quot;
</pre>

<p>
Once you have saved the file, you are now ready to start up the DHCP d&aelig;mon to see if the
configuration file is valid or not.
</p>

<h2>Starting Up ISC DHCP</h2>
<p>
If you installed ISC DHCP from the Ports collection, the installer will automatically place a startup
script under <code>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</code> named <code>isc-dhcpd.sh.sample</code>. In order for it to be
picked up when the system is starting up, rename it to <code>isc-dhcpd.sh</code> and make sure that it has
the executable bit set. Once the file has been renamed, you can startup the d&aelig;mon by running
the following as root:
</p>

<pre>
	# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/isc-dhcpd.sh start
</pre>

<p>
<span id="noports">If</span> you have built and installed the service from a tarball, you will first
need to create the <code>isc-dhcpd.sh</code> under <code>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</code>. Instead of storing the
interfaces and command options under <code>/usr/local/etc/rc.isc-dhcpd.conf</code>, you will need to store
them in the <code>isc-dhcpd.sh</code>. You will need to replace <code>xl0</code> for the <code>dhcpd_ifaces</code>
variable to the interface that you want the DHCP d&aelig;mon to listen on for requests.
</p>

<pre>
	#!/bin/sh
	PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin

	# set startup options here
	dhcpd_ifaces=&quot;xl0&quot;
	dhcpd_options=&quot;-q&quot;

	case &quot;$1&quot; in
	start)
		/usr/sbin/dhcpd ${dhcpd_options} ${dhcpd_ifaces} &amp;&amp;
		echo -n &quot; dhcpd&quot;
		;;
	stop)
		killall -9 dhcpd
		;;
	restart)
		$0 stop
		$0 start
		;;
	else)
		echo &quot;usage: isc-dhcpd.sh {start|stop|restart}&quot;
		;;
	esac
</pre>

<p>
Once the d&aelig;mon has started, you will want to check <code>/var/log/messages</code> to make sure that
no errors have been dumped into syslog. When the d&aelig;mon is running, the active DHCP leases will be
stored in <code>/var/db/dhcpd.leases</code> in a format that closely resembles the DHCP d&aelig;mon
configuration file.
</p>

<h2>Getting Additional Help</h2>
<p>
Once you get your DHCP server up and running, there will be times that you will need to configure your
server to handle devices that require special BOOTP settings, setup a failover DHCP server for
high-availability, or any other more advanced configurations. There are quite a few resources that you
can refer to to help you out.
