Published three years ago, <span class="BookTitle">UNIX in a Nutshell</span> is a full reference book
aimed at system administrators (or sysadmins) as a book that can be used to reference any of the
commands and utilities included in UNIX. Unfortunately, the book was geared at System V and its UNIX
derivatives; therefore, it may not be quite as useful for BSD sysadmins nor is it portable enough to
carry in one's pocket to reference when working away from a desk or on the road. Recently published,
a companion to <span class="BookTitle">Essential System Administration, 3rd Edition</span>
(<a href="esa3.html">reviewed this month</a>) is a quick pocket reference for the command, tools and
important topics that can be found in the full book. Since it was done after the release of the full
book, the round-up of the covered operating systems has been updated, with the exception of HP/Compaq
Tru64 (or Digital) UNIX, to include the latest versions. Below is the list of operating systems covered.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>IBM AIX 5</li>
	<li>FreeBSD 4.7 (which is called &quot;Free BSD&quot; on the back cover)</li>
	<li>HP-UX 11</li>
	<li>Sun Solaris 8 and 9</li>
	<li>RedHat Linux 8.0 and SuSE Linux 8.1</li>
</ul>

<p>
Below is the table of contents for the pocket reference.
</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" border="0" width="100%">
<tr valign="top">
	<td style="width: 50%">
		<ul>
			<li>The root Account</li>
			<li>Essential Administrative Tools</li>
			<li>Devices and Device Files</li>
			<li>File Ownership and Protection</li>
			<li>System Messages and Log Files</li>
			<li>Startup and Shutdown</li>
			<li>User Accounts</li>
			<li>Process and Resource Management</li>
		</ul>
	</td>
	<td style="width: 50%">
		<ul>
			<li>Filesystems and Disks</li>
			<li>Printing</li>
			<li>Serial Lines</li>
			<li>Networking</li>
			<li>Electronic Mail</li>
			<li>Security</li>
			<li>Kernel Configuration</li>
		</ul>

<p>
Under each section, the author includes an explanation of each command and its options and arguments
(along with the different option and argument variations used across the different systems), file
locations for files related to its topic, configuration file syntax, and checklists for important
topics. For example, starting on page 100: the different options and syntax used in both the BIND
configuration file, <tt>named.conf</tt>, and the domain map files.
</p>

<p>
In addition to configuration file syntax and command arguments, there are some tables scattered
throughout the pocket reference that can very, very useful. The one that sysadmins will mostly likely
love the most is the <acronym title="Classless Inter-Domain Routing">CIDR</acronym> table, on page
100, containing CIDR suffixes (in slash notation), its more common dotted-quad subnet mask, and the
maximum number of hosts available in the respective subnet (with the network number and the broadcast
address subtracted from the count). On the opposite page is another table that lists commonly used TCP
and UDP (which is misspelled as &quot;UPD&quot;) ports and its associated service.
</p>

<p>
Being the first printing and edition, there are some typos that I found while reading through it. The
first one that stood out was the variables listed for enabling or setting the syslog d&aelig;mon in
FreeBSD on page 23. The second variable listed is &quot;<tt>syslogd_flag</tt>&quot;; instead, it should
be &quot;<tt>syslogd_flags</tt>&quot;. On page 126, the author listed the kernel build directory for
FreeBSD as &quot;<tt>/usr/src/sys/<var>arch</var>/conf</tt>&quot;, which is actually the location of
the kernel configuration file location. The kernel build directory (when using the old kernel compile
method) should be &quot;<tt>/usr/src/sys/compile/<var>kernel-name</var></tt>&quot; Also, the reason why
I italicized <tt><var>arch</var></tt> is that the author should have made a note for the reader to
replace it with the architecture moniker for which the kernel should be built for (this occurs on both
page 126 and on page 127).
</p>

<p>
Although the author mentions a downloadable log rotation tool, <tt>logrotate</tt> in the &quot;System
Messages and Log Files&quot; section, FreeBSD's <tt>newsyslog</tt> utility was not covered.
<tt>newsyslog</tt> can be used to not only rotate the system log file based on the file's size or on a
routine basis, but it can also be used to rotate Apache log files or other program output file. Under
the &quot;Startup and Shutdown&quot; section, the author lists <tt>/etc/rc.*</tt> for FreeBSD's
&quot;Secondary boot scripts/script directories&quot;, but does not include <tt>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</tt>
as a startup/shutdown script directory.
</p>

<p>
Looking past the mistakes (which is mostly forgivable since it is the first printing and edition), the
pocket reference is something that many sysadmins - including myself - will find to be very useful in the
field. There are times that you need to know which command option does what, but a man page could just
have a cryptic explanation for it. One option that could be very appealing for some sysadmin is an
eBook version of the pocket reference that can be viewed on a PDA. Unless you have memorized every
command and its options and variations across the different UNIX systems, the pocket reference is
something I would highly recommend getting.
