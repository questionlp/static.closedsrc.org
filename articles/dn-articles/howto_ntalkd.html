When you think of chat services, the first thing to that properly comes to mind is IRC or even BBS chat
rooms from the days of yore. Setting up a server for IRC chat services or a BBS isn't always an easy
feat nor is it very efficient for chatting with a couple of people at once. There are instant messaging
services like AOL Instant Messenger, Jabber or MSN Messenger which provide a solution for sending quick
messages back and forth with another person (some also have chat room facilities) but are not consider
too secure. Thankfully, FreeBSD provides a service that fall in-between in-between instant messaging
services and chat rooms which provides a quick and simple solution for chatting called ntalk and using
the talk or ytalk client. I will cover how to setup the ntalk d&aelig;mon, restrict access to the service,
and a basic instructions on how to use both clients.
</p>

<h2>Setting Up ntalkd</h2>
<p>
The ntalk d&aelig;mon is included with any FreeBSD installation and it is installed under
<code>/usr/libexec</code> as <code>ntalkd</code>. Like many services available, the d&aelig;mon needs to be
enabled within <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>. Some machines may already have the ntalk d&aelig;mon enabled,
but not all do. To enable the service, make sure that you have inetd enabled and running by adding
<code>inetd_enable=&quot;YES&quot;</code> or changing <code>NO</code> to <code>YES</code> if
<code>inetd_enable=&quot;NO&quot;</code> in <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> if it is already present. Once you have
enabled inetd in <code>rc.conf</code>, find the following line in your <code>inetd.conf</code> file and
remove the hash mark (<code>#</code>) from the beginning of the line:
</p>

<pre>
	#ntalk  dgram   udp     wait    tty:tty /usr/libexec/ntalkd     ntalkd
</pre>

<p>
and save the file. If inetd is already running, run
</p>

<pre>
	kill -HUP `echo /var/run/inetd.pid`
</pre>

<p>
to tell the d&aelig;mon to re-read the configuration file. If it inetd is not running, run
</p>

<pre>
	/usr/sbin/inetd -wW
</pre>

<p>
to start it up.
</p>

<p>
By enabling and running the inetd d&aelig;mon, you have a chance of opening your host to possible
hack attempts if it is setup to run services like telnet or rsh. To help lock down access to
&quot;tcp wrapped&quot; services and inetd d&aelig;mons, you can use the <code>hosts.allow</code> facility
to allow and deny specific hosts or IP address ranges. You can learn more on how to setup and use
<code>hosts.allow</code> by checking out the
&quot;<a href="hosts_allow.html">HOWTO - Limiting Access to TCP-Wrapped Services With hosts.allow</a>&quot;
article in this month's issue. The service name that you would want to use to restrict access to ntalk via
<code>hosts.allow</code> is <code>ntalkd</code>. Since ntalk is uses the UDP protocol, some of the options in
<code>hosts.allow</code> will not be available.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, there really isn't any configuration or tweaking that you need to do to make the service
work. Simple, no?
</p>

<h2>Using The talk Clients To Chat</h2>
<h3>The talk Client</h3>
<p>
Also included with the ntalk d&aelig;mon is the simplistic <code>talk</code> client which allows you to chat
with another user. The syntax for running the <code>talk</code> client is:
</p>

<pre>
	talk <var>person</var> [ttyname]
</pre>

<p>
The definition of the arguments are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>person</dt>
	<dd>This can simply be the username of the person that you want to chat with if that person is
	on the same host as you, or in the form of <code><var>user</var>@<var>host</var></code> where
	<var>host</var> is the remote host (which can be specified as an IP address, a relative hostname,
	or a full qualified domain name). The remote host must be running a talk d&aelig;mon and allow
	your machine access to it in order to talk to someone on that remote host.</dd>

	<dt>ttyname</dt>
	<dd>(Optional) If the user is logged into multiple terminals, you can direct your talk request to
	that specific terminal by including the full terminal device name (for example: <code>ttyp1</code>
	if that user is logged into <code>p1</code>). You can find out the terminal(s) that a user is logged
	into by running the <code>w</code> command.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
When you run the <code>talk</code> command with a proper user (and terminal name if need be), it will try to
connect to the host (local or remote) and then it sends a message to the user asking them to run:
</p>

<pre>
	talk <var>your-username</var>@<var>your-host</var>
</pre>

<p>
You will get the same message when someone sends you a talk request. If you accidentally typed in a wrong
username and/or host, or if the user or host is not available, then it will return an error message.
</p>

<p>
When you run the proper <code>talk</code> command and arguments, the talk client will appear on the screen
with panes. The top pane is what you would type in and the bottom pane is what the remote user's response
will be printed. To exit out of the client, press <code>CTRL+C</code> (or C-c for EMACS users, or ^C if you
prefer). One of the disadvantages of the <code>talk</code> program is that it will only allow for a chat
with one other person.
</p>

<h3>The ytalk Client</h3>
<p>
The <code>ytalk</code> client has one feature that is glaringly missing in the standard <code>talk</code>, the
ability to talk to multiple people at the same time and using one instance of the client. Another
feature of the <code>ytalk</code> client is that it includes a native X11 interface for those you are running
X Windows and want a more <em>native</em> looking client. <code>ytalk</code> is not included with the base
install, but can easily be installed from the Ports collection. To install the client, run <code>make
all install</code> within the <code>/usr/ports/net/ytalk</code> directory. Any specific configuration commands
that you want to make should be added to the <code>.ytalkrc</code> in your home directory. Configuration
commands that affect all users should be placed in <code>/usr/local/etc/ytalkrc</code>. For a detailed list
of configuration commands and options, check out the man page for <code>ytalk</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>ytalk</code> command uses a slightly different syntax than the regular <code>talk</code> client, many
of which aren't really needed in most cases, but you can feel free to look at them in the ytalk(1) man
page. The basic syntax of the command is:
</p>

<pre>
	ytalk [-x] <var>username</var> ...
</pre>

<p>
where <code>-x</code> disables the X11 interface (which is implied if the <code>DISPLAY</code> environment
variable is not set). <code>ytalk</code> accepts several different syntaxes for the <var>username</var>
argument as described below.
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>name</dt>
	<dd>Simply the username of the person you want to chat to, if he/she is on the same host as you are.</dd>

	<dt>name#tty</dt>
	<dd>If the person is logged into multiple terminals, you can target the request to a specific by
	using the full terminal name (like <code>ttyp2</code> in place of <code>tty</code>.</dd>

	<dt>name@host</dt>
	<dd>This is the same as the <code>talk</code> client where <code>host</code> is the name of the remote host
	which the user is logged in to.</dd>

	<dt>name#tty@host and name@host#tty</dt>
	<dd>A combination of <code>name#tty</code> and <code>name@host</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Once you have started <code>ytalk</code> and are placed into the client, which looks fairly similar to the
<code>talk</code> client. It will start off one pane until the person you invited joins in (or automatically
splits into the appropriate number of panes if you were invited to a chat).
</p>

<p>
The <code>ytalk</code> client provides a pop-up menu, which is accessed and dismissed by pressing the
<code>ESC</code> key, that allows you to invite, bump off current chat partcipants, or bump off any invited
but not connected people, plus provide options and other commands that allow you to customize the session or be
more flexible or productive when a chat suddenly gets quiet. Again, you can find out more about the options
in the <code>ytalk(1)</code> man page. Below is a screenshot of the <code>ytalk</code> menu.
</p>

<pre>
                          ###########################
                          #        Main Menu        #
                          #                         #
                          # a: add a user           #
                          # d: delete a user        #
                          # k: kill all unconnected #
                          # o: options              #
                          # s: shell                #
                          # u: user list            #
                          # w: output user to file  #
                          # q: quit                 #
                          ###########################
</pre>

<p>
You can quit out of the client through the Main Menu or by pressing <code>CTRL+C</code> on the keyboard. I
personally like to use <code>ytalk</code> when chatting with the D&aelig;mon News crew since a conversation
can start off with another person, but someone else can be requested to join or just pop in at any
time without having to run multiple <code>talk</code> clients.
</p>

<h3>Other Notes</h3>
<p>
If you use the Pine e-mail client in a console and someone is trying to send you a talk request, the
Pine e-mail client will (by default) ignore the request and will not rely it to you. You can change that
behavior by going into the Pine configure screen and make sure that the option &quot;allow-talk&quot;
under the &quot;Advanced User Preferences&quot; section is checked. You can also enable the option by
making sure that <code>allow-talk</code> is listed within the <code>feature-list</code> option set. With the
option set, talk requests will pop up in the terminal over anything being displayed by Pine.
</p>

<p>
Like many instant messaging services and IRC, all of the conversations sent to remote users will be in
plain-text; therefore, it is not recommended that you send sensitive information across the wire without
some sort of encryption. One way to workaround this limitation, you can SSH into a server that has both
the d&aelig;mon installed and the client and start your conversation from there. The other user(s)
should either be located directly on that host via a console or SSH'd into the host to keep the
conversation data from being sent outside of the talk host without any form of encryption. I haven't
tried to use any form of SSH port forwarding to connect to remote talk hosts, though I'm not sure if
it would work since the <code>talk</code> service uses the UDP protocol instead of TCP.
</p>

<p>
If you want to make the talk service available from a talk host behind a firewall available to the
public Internet, you will need to let UDP port 518 through. <!--According to the <code>/etc/services</code>
file that came from 4.6-RC, it shows that <code>ntalk</code> also uses the TCP port 518 as well, but I'm not quite
sure if it that is correct or not.-->
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Although <code>ntalk</code> doesn't provide luxury features like file uploads and downloads, cute little
graphical emoticons, or other features integrated into their respective portals or network as AOL
Instant Messenger or IRC, but it does provide a lightweight and very simple way of chatting with your
friends, co-workers, or other people without having to run graphical or bloated text console clients.
Instead, it stays true to the way many Unix utilities and programs are (and should be written): each
program should be as simple as possible without unneeded bells and whistles.
