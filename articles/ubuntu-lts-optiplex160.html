	<h1>Installing Ubuntu Server 8.04 LTS on a Dell OptiPlex 160</h1>
	<div class="byline"><span class="name">Linh Pham</span></div>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		This article describes the process of installing Ubuntu Server 8.04 LTS on a Dell
		OptiPlex 160 desktop, which can be used as a workgroup file and print server, or
		as an energy-efficient web and e-mail server.

	<h2 id="s-Hardware">Hardware</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		Before going into the installation and configuration process, an overview of the
		desktop is in order. The OptiPlex 160 (and its relative, the OptiPlex FX160
		thin-client) is a very small form factor desktop computer that contains an Intel
		Atom processor, supports up to 4GB of RAM and either a 2.5&quot; SATA hard drive or
		an SSD flash module. The Intel Atom processor is available either as a single-core
		or a dual-core version, both running at 1.6GHz with a front-side bus speed of
		533MT/s and each core has 512KB of cache. Bundled with the Intel Atom processor is
		an SiS chipset combination (M671 northbridge, 968 southbridge and Mirage 3D
		integrated video using shared memory), along with a Broadcom BCM5764M Gigabit
		Ethernet NIC and an open half-size Mini PCIe slot for a Dell Wireless 1397 802.11b/g
		card. Any optical drive must be in the form of an external USB drive.

		The OptiPlex FX160 differs in that it is bundled with a lightweight build of SuSE
		Linux on a flash module and is sold as a thin client. This article covers the
		installation process of the standard OptiPlex 160 with a traditional hard drive,
		but the steps provided would also apply to a model with an SSD flash module.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2 id="s-Models">n-Series Models and Alternates</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		Outside of the OptiPlex FX160, the OptiPlex 160 can only be ordered with Windows
		through Dell's website. In order to order an n-Series version of an OptiPlex 160,
		you will need to go through your Dell Account Manager. The n-Series version includes
		a CD with FreeDOS and does not include the Windows tax, which is perfect for the
		purposes outlined in this article.

		If an OptiPlex 160 cannot be procured for non-business uses, another option is the
		Dell Zino HD desktop computer, which has a form-factor that is akin to an Apple Mac
		mini. The Zino HD uses a single-core or dual-core AMD processor, supports a
		3.5&quot; SATA hard drive and an internal optical drive. Building up a Zino HD is
		beyond the scope of this article, but should be able to accept a recent version of
		Ubuntu Server.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2 id="s-PreInstall">Pre-Installation Tasks</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		Without an internal optical drive, the operating system must be installed from an
		external USB optical drive or a USB memory stick. This article covers the
		installation using an external USB optical drive. Please refer to the Ubuntu
		documentation website for instructions on how to prepare and create an installer
		for a USB memory stick. Make sure that the installation media is plugged in before
		powering up the system.
		</p>

		<p>
		Before Ubuntu Server 8.04 LTS can be installed, several BIOS settings must be
		changed in order to have the kernel to detect the hard drive. Power up the system
		and enter the BIOS and go into the <samp>Drives</samp> section and change the
		<samp>SATA Operation</samp> setting from <samp><var>AHCI</var></samp> to
		<samp><var>ATA</var></samp>.
		</p>

		<p>
		If the system will not be running a desktop environment, such as GNOME, KDE or XFCE,
		go into the <samp>Onboard Devices</samp> section and change <samp>Video Memory
		Size</samp> from <samp><var>128MB</var></samp> to <samp><var>32MB</var></samp>.
		This will reduce the shared memory space used by the integrated graphics controller
		and increase the available memory for the operating system.
		</p>

		<p>
		Save BIOS settings and exit from the BIOS.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2 id="s-Install">Installing Ubuntu Server 8.04 LTS</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		Next, boot from the installation media by going into the boot device selection menu
		(press <kbd>F12</kbd> when prompted at the boot screen).
		</p>

		<p>
		Once the Ubuntu installation boot menu is started, select the appropriate menu
		language, then press <kbd>F6</kbd> to bring up the boot command line. Move the
		cursor left, so that it is before <samp>--</samp> and add
		<code>noapic vga=<var>xxx</var>&nbsp;</code>. The <code>noapic</code> parameter
		disables the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC), which can cause an
		error message to be displayed and the system to hang during bootup. Press
		<kbd>ENTER</kbd> to proceed.
		</p>

		<p>Depending on the display being used, the VGA code number, <code><var>xxx</var></code>,
		needs to reflect the resolution supported by the attached display. Typically the
		value of <code><var>771</var></code> will work with most displays, as it sets the
		frame buffer to 800x600 with 256 colors. Refer to the
		&quot;<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ConsoleFramebuffer">ConsoleFrameBuffer</a>&quot;
		article on the Community Ubuntu Documentation website for various VGA codes.
		</p>

		<p>
		Proceed through the Ubuntu Server 8.04 LTS installation process as with any other
		Ubuntu Server install.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2 id="s-PostInstall">Post-Installation Tasks</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
		After Ubuntu Server 8.04 LTS has been installed on the system, the GRUB boot menu
		configuration file needs to be modified to include the <code>noapic</code>
		parameter to each of the kernel boot options. To do so, edit the
		<code>/etc/grub/menu.lst</code> file and locate the
		<code>## ## End Default Options ##</code>. At the end of the <code>kernel</code>
		line for each <code>Ubuntu 8.04</code> boot option, append it with <code>noapic</code>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Save the file and restart the system to boot kernel with the APIC disabled. This
		change will need to be made each time a new kernel version is installed.
		</p>

		<p>
		Once the system is booted with APIC support disabled, the default hard drive
		power management setting in Ubuntu needs to be modified to reduce wear on the
		hard drive (there is a known issue with Ubuntu 8.04 LTS that agressively shuts
		off a hard drive). To immediately disable power management on the hard drive, run:
		</p>

<pre class="codeSnippet">
sudo hdparm -B 255 /dev/sda
</pre>

		<p>
		To disable power management on the hard drive each time the system is started,
		modify <code>/etc/hdparm.conf</code> and add the following to the end of the file:
		</p>

<pre class="codeSnippet">
/dev/sda {
	apm = 255
}
</pre>

		<p>
		Save the file and exit from the text editor.
		</p>

		<p>
		If the hard drive installed in the system supports
		<abbr title="Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology">SMART</abbr>, it
		can be monitored with the <code>smartmontools</code> package. To install the
		package and enable <abbr>SMART</abbr> on the hard drive, run the following commands:
		</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install smartmontools
sudo smartctl -d ata -s on /dev/sda
</pre>

		<p>
		To enable the <abbr>SMART</abbr> monitoring d&aelig;mon when the system is started,
		modify <code>/etc/default/smartmontools</code> to look like:
		</p>

<pre>
# Defaults for smartmontools initscript (/etc/init.d/smartmontools)
# This is a POSIX shell fragment

# List of devices you want to explicitly enable S.M.A.R.T. for
# Not needed (and not recommended) if the device is monitored by smartd
enable_smart="/dev/sda"

# uncomment to start smartd on system startup
start_smartd=yes

# uncomment to pass additional options to smartd on startup
smartd_opts="--interval=1800"
</pre>

		<p>
		The <abbr>SMART</abbr> monitoring d&aelig;mon configuration file also needs to be
		modified to contain only the following line:
		</p>

<pre>
/dev/sda -a -d sat -o on -S on -s (S/../.././02|L/../../1/03) -m <var>admin@example.org</var>
</pre>

		<p>
		Once the configuration file has been modified and saved, the d&aelig;mon can be
		started by running:
		</p>

<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/smartmontools start
</pre>

		<p>
		The d&aelig;mon will run a quick test on the hard drive each night and a long test
		once per week. If any problems arise, an e-mail will be sent.
		</p>
