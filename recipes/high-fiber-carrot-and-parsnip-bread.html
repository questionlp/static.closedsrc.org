<h2>Description and Notes</h2>
<div id="description">
<p>
This recipe was thought up as an alternative to sugar-laden bran muffins or high-fiber carrot cake-style cookies.
While the original recipe contains only parsnips, this recipe replaces half of the parsnips with carrots to give an additional boost of natural sweetness.
</p>
<p>
For those with nut allergies, parsnips brings along a light, nutty flavor without actually adding nuts.
Also, for those that have gluten allergies, gluten-free flours can be used in place of the oat flour; though, this may require making changes to the quantity of several ingredients.

	<li>Measure out and combine the dry ingredients (flours, baking powder and soda, spices and salt) in a small mixing bowl.</li>
	<li>In a larger mixing bowl, beat the eggs until lightened in color, then whisk in the oil until fully combined.
	Next, whisk in the yogurt, vanilla, agave syrup and sugar until thoroughly combined.</li>
	<li>Fold in the ground flaxseeds and the grated carrot and parsnip (add raisins or dried currants if desired).</li>
	<li>Evenly spread the batter across the two loaf pans or into the one Bundt cake pan.</li>
	<li>Bake at 375 degrees F for 35 minutes, then reduce oven to 325 and continue to bake until an inserted toothpick comes out with a handful of crumbs.</li>
	<li>Remove from oven and cool on wire cooking racks. When still slightly warm to the touch, remove from pans and serve warm or cool.</li>
</ul>
